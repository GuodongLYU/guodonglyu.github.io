    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> A key challenge in the resource allocation problem is to find near-optimal policies to serve different customers with random demands/revenues, using a fixed pool of capacity (properly configured). In this paper, we study the properties of three classes of allocation policies—responsive (with perfect hindsight and full visibility), adaptive (with information updates and limited visibility), and anticipative (without any visibility) policies. These policies differ in how the information on actual demand and revenue of each customer is being revealed and integrated into the allocation decisions. We show that the analysis of these policies can be unified through the notion of “persistency” (or service level) values—the probability that a customer is being (completely) served in the optimal responsive policy. We analyze and compare the performances of these policies for both capacity minimization (with given persistency targets) and revenue maximization (with given capacity) models. In both models, the performance gaps between optimal anticipative policies and adaptive policies are shown to be bounded when the demand and revenue of each item are independently generated. In contrast, the gaps between the optimal adaptive policies and responsive policies can be arbitrarily large. More importantly, we show that the techniques developed, and the persistency values obtained from the optimal responsive policies can be used to design good adaptive and anticipative policies for the other two variants of resource allocation problems. This provides a unified approach to the design and analysis of algorithms for these problems. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">In many production environments, a fixed network of capacity is shared flexibly between multiple products with random demands. What is the best way to configure the capacity of the production network and to allocate the available capacity to meet predetermined fill rate requirements? We develop a new approach for network capacity configuration and allocation and characterize the relationship between the capacity of the network and the attainable fill rate levels for the products, taking into account the flexibility structure of the network. This builds on a new randomized allocation mechanism to deliver the desired services. We use this theory to investigate the connection between the flexibility structure and capacity configuration. We provide a new perspective to the well-known phenomenon that “long chain is almost as good as the fully flexible network”: for given target fill rates, the required capacity level in a long-chain network is close to that in a fully flexible network and is much lower than a dedicated system. We apply these insights and techniques on problems arising in the design of last-mile delivery operations and in semiconductor production planning, using real data from two companies. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
      We study a class of multi-objective stochastic optimization problems, in which a decision maker takes actions to balance the trade-offs among multiple objectives. We model the problem to minimize the distance between the policy's vector of realized multi-objective values (i.e., attained KPIs) and a vector of pre-determined target KPIs.  We develop an efficient algorithm to derive the "compromise" solution, which minimizes the l_p-norm-based distance function from the attained KPIs to the target. Technically, we first transform the multi-objective stochastic optimization problem into a sample-average-approximation (SAA) optimization problem and develop an online algorithm to obtain the "compromise" solution to this reformulated problem. Next, we exploit the fact that the online algorithm uses only gradient information from historical (i.e., past) sample information, and not the current state of the system. This allows us to recast the online algorithm into a randomized policy for the original stochastic optimization problem and provides transparent decision rules for this class of problems. The methods and analysis are developed for stochastic optimization problems with and without recourse. Through numerical experiments and industrial testing using real data from a ride-sourcing platform, we demonstrate that our approach indeed obtains solutions that are closest to the pre-determined targets under various settings, in comparison to existing approaches. The policy presents solutions with delicate balance among multiple objectives and brings value to all the stakeholders in the ride-sourcing ecosystem comparing to benchmark policies: (1) drivers with higher service scores are dispatched with more orders and receive higher incomes; (2) passengers are more likely to be served by drivers with higher service scores, and passengers with higher order revenues are served with higher answer rates, at the expense of a small increase in pick-up distance; (3) the platform obtains a higher total revenue. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> One of the central issues in (finite horizon) online planning problems is to synthesize the impact of real time decisions on the subsequent states of the system, and the performance in the remaining time horizon (cost-to-go function). A complete resolution often leads to intractable dynamic programming problems. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient approach to this problem that attains near-optimal performance in non-stationary environments. More specifically, we study a general class of online planning problems with concave objective functions and (global) feasibility constraints. A wide range of problems in supply chain management, online advertising, and network revenue management etc., can be appropriately modelled using this online planning framework. Leveraging on the value of the "gradient" information obtained from offline simulation (generated from the distributional information), we develop a generic approach to facilitate online planning for this class of problems. Furthermore, our proposed approach produces near optimal solution with sublinear regret and satisfies the feasibility constraints with high probability. We present extensive numerical evidence to validate the performance of this approach, and discuss its improvement over existing techniques that assume the underlying environment is stationary. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> The Singapore government has recently proposed the concept of "Locker Alliance" (LA), an interoperable network of public lockers in residential areas and hot spots in community, to improve the efficiency of last mile parcel delivery operations. This is to complement the existing infrastructure, comprising mainly of proprietary lockers and collection points in commercial areas set up by large delivery companies. How do we determine the density and coverage of the LA network, to promote adoption of locker pickup in Singapore? What will be the impact on the delivery profile in the central business district, far from the residential areas?  In this paper, we discuss the operational challenges associated with the problem of public locker installation in a city, following a new smart nation initiative in Singapore. We use a set of locker usage data from a commercial courier company to calibrate a locker choice model, to determine the impact of walking distance on locker pickup intentions. We use the current (observed) parcel delivery profile to develop a facility location model for the LA network. We use this model to extrapolate and approximate the true adoption and new delivery profiles when the LA network is built. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our model does not always place lockers near areas with peak parcel volume (in pre-existing data), because the LA lockers provide another option for customers to pick up from lockers near residential areas. Furthermore, the model suggests that a coverage of 250 meters is appropriate for the LA network in Singapore.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Singapore's local delivery companies launched their own network of parcel lockers as a much-needed alternative to traditional doorstep delivery, and unintendingly as a potential solution to Singapore's last mile delivery challenges. However, this fragmented set of competitive networks created its own set of problems. In response, the Singapore government rolled out an ambitious plan to set up an agnostic nationwide network of 1,000 parcel lockers, to be located at public residential areas and places with high foot traffic. To test this, it launched on December 2018 a pilot program of a small network of around 70 parcel lockers located in two towns in Singapore. We assisted the Singapore government in the analysis of the pilot study. We conducted several studies with the aim to provide it with recommendations that will increase consumer adoption of these parcel lockers. Hence, we studied the factors that have affected early adoption of the lockers from the pilot and identified the reasons why consumers have chosen to use the lockers or not. We also determined the right target market which policy makers should focus their marketing campaigns on, to increase adoption of the lockers. We used data from a three rounds-consumer survey we conducted on 2,271 participants starting on October 2018 (before the pilot), and all delivery transactions made to the lockers from the pilot program in the period Dec 2018 to Aug 2019. We conducted three studies with this set of data. One, using a classification tree, another using text analytics and a customer segmentation study using the k-means clustering algorithm. The first two studies led us to conclude that familiarity with lockers is key to increase consumer adoption, and the third one that the correct target market to increase use of lockers are young and low income female frequent shoppers. More specifically, the classification tree determined that if lockers from the pilot are the delivery option consumers are most familiar with, then there is a 49% probability they will use these lockers. The text analytics study concluded that three out of the top four reasons why consumers did not want to use the lockers from the pilot are due to their lack of familiarity with the lockers. They found the lockers to be far and difficult to locate, difficult to use, and they thought they were not available during check-out. Finally, the customer segmentation study found that the correct target market to increase use of lockers are young female frequent shoppers who earn less than $4,500 a month, shop mostly for women’s fashion, and frequently use returns, miss deliveries and use lockers from other companies. We also reporting the adoption of the lockers throughout the pilot.</div></p>

In total, we have collected M = 13, 719 weekly orders for N = 1, 166 different stock keeping units (SKUs) in the two fulfillment channels facilitated by Amazon – (i) Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), and (ii) Fulfillment by Seller (FBS, also known as Fulfillment by Merchant). The orders for some SKUs were fulfilled entirely by seller (FBS) during their life cycles on Amazon, while the rest were first fulfilled by seller (FBS) for several months (testing period), before being transferred to FBA. This data set serves to illuminate the impact of cross-border fulfillment options on sales and bottom line of e-retailers. </div></p>

In this paper, using data from a wedding gown E-retailer in China, we analyze the differences between two fulfillment choices — Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and Fulfillment by Seller (FBS). In particular, we want to understand the impact of FBA that will bring to sales and profit, compared to FBS, and how the impact is related to product features such as sizes and colors. We develop a risk-adjusted fulfillment model to address this problem, where the e-retailer’s risk attitude to FBA is incorporated. We denote the profit gaps between FBA and FBS as the rewards for this E-retailer fulfilling products using FBA, our goal is to maximize the E-retailer’s total rewards using predictive analytics. We adopt the Generalized Linear Model to predict the expected rewards, while controlling for the variability of the reward distribution. We apply our model on a set of real data, and develop an explicit decision rule that can be easily implemented in practice. The numerical experiments show that our interpretable decision rule can improve the E-retailer’s total rewards by more than 35%. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> The key challenge in sustainable urban logistics is to reduce carbon footprint generated from last mile parcel delivery activities. The Locker Alliance Network (LAN) is a recent nationwide initiative introduced in Singapore for parcel pickup by customers, to improve the efficiency of last mile delivery operation. To test out the effectiveness of LAN, and to ensure a smooth and successful implementation of the nationwide project, the government initiated a pilot progrm in two town areas of the Singapore city. The pilot program conducted a series of study that covers various aspect of the implemented locker network in the two towns. And the government is looking for a nationwide LAN implementation plan, based on the key observations obtained in pilot program. In this paper, we study how does the design of locker network impact the efficiency of last mile delivery. With the installation of LAN, the customers can choose to pick up parcels at a locker or to remain for home delivery service. The Logistic Service Provider(LSP) has to arrange two seperate trips for the two different type of services: one trip through all installed lockers and the other through all home delivery request. With more lockers being installed, LAN might attract more customers to locker station and the length of delivery to homes will decrease, at a price of length of delivery to lockers increase. We develop a nonlinear Prize-Collecting TSP model to analyze the trade-off between two delivery trips, where the trip through all lockers is modelled as the TSP part and the reduction of delivery to home is modelled as the prize collecting part. Under the logit choice behaviour of customers, our model can be reformulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program(MI-SOCP). This allows us to solve fairly large scale LAN design problem. Using the data obtained from pilot program, we show that a well-constructed LAN can reduce total amount of carbon footprint by at least 20\%.</div></p> -->

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Designing and planning humanitarian supply chains for post-disaster response is extremely challenging because of the disruption in supply chains under uncertain decision environment coupled with great urgency. Different from other decisions under uncertainty, one of the most critical issues in humanitarian operations is that supply and demand are not only uncertain but the uncertainties can be highly correlated. Therefore, conventional wisdom of risk pooling and risk diversification would fail. Ignoring such correlation information can lead to significantly suboptimal strategies. The present study considers the post-disaster relief resource logistics planning problem with correlated uncertainties in the supply network and demands. We adopt a two- stage distributionally robust approach to determine the optimal logistics plan which directly incorporates the correlation information. We demonstrate that this two-stage distributionally robust problem is equivalent to a conic programming problem that can be solved through a positive semi-definite program. Moreover, the solution to the conic program explicitly quantifies the impact of correlated uncertainties on relief per- formance. This analytical framework is applied to address a post-disaster humanitarian logistics planning problem in the Typhoon Haiyan case. Through numerical simulations, we validate the significant impact of correlation information on logistics planning. Furthermore, if the information of correlated uncertainties is not considered, there would be a loss in post-disaster relief effort. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Cash transfer programs (CTPs) have spread across the globe in the last decade to deal with the challenge of poverty reduction, to make the world a better place. An essential step in operations of CTPs is to make efficient and egalitarian cash allocation plans under imperfect targeting using various proxy measures. Depending on whether cash allocation is determined based on actual income or predicted income, we demonstrate how recent advances in the area of robust optimization and online convex optimization can be used to deal with cash allocation problem in both environments. More concretely, under the setting of simultaneous allocation (based on actual income), we characterize the structure of the optimal policy - min-max stock-out policy - in the cash allocation problem. We use the notion of ex-ante service level guarantee to ensure that cash will be equitably allocated across all beneficiaries, even though the allocation decision is ex-post. Under the setting of static allocation (based on predicted income), we use the notion of robustness optimization to mitigate the negative impact of imperfect targeting. Interestingly, both cash allocation methods can be efficiently computed using online convex optimization. Using real data from a cash transfer program in Malawi, we demonstrate that our allocation policies can improve both the efficiency and egalitarian objectives of the cash transfer program. Moreover, the wealth distribution is more "fair" because the wealth distribution after allocation is "smoother", reducing the bunching effect that may be undesirable in some circumstances. Our policies can partly mitigate the imperfect targeting issue and push more beneficiaries above the extreme poverty line.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Crowd management during peak commuting hours is a key challenge facing metro systems worldwide, which results in serious safety concerns and uneven service experience for commuters on different origin-destination (o-d) pairs. This paper uses recent methods in multi-objective stochastic dynamic programs to develop real-time passenger flow control policies to manage the inflow of crowds at each station, to optimize the total load carried or revenue earned (efficiency), and to ensure that adequate service is provided to passengers on each o-d pair (fairness), as much as possible. This problem is challenging in part because information on o-d demands is known only upon arrival of the train at the station. We study two kinds of flow control policies that differ in whether we can sort the crowd and admit or reject based on destination stations. For given train capacity, we use  Blackwell's approachability theorem and Fenchel duality to characterize the achievable service level (fill rate) targets of each o-d pair using a class of convex conjugate functions. We use these insights to develop online policies for the crowd control problems. Numerical experiments on a set of transit data from Beijing show that our approach is promising -- it improves upon the benchmark first-come-first-serve (FCFS) policy by utilizing information in a more effective manner, with higher efficiency and service levels delivered to the passengers. Furthermore, the efficiency and fairness improvements obtained from our policies increase as the metro line becomes more saturated. We conclude that striving for fairness in service deliveries across o-d pairs can actually lead to higher load and efficiency for metro lines, compared to the myopic FCFS policy!</div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We study adaptive shortest-path network interdiction problem, where the interdictor sequentially allocates limited resources to interdict a subset of arcs in a network so as to maximize the length of the shortest-path traversed by a malicious evader. In contrast to the class of static interdiction policies, which is configured a priori and implemented throughout the entire game without any changes, the interdiction decisions are sequentially updated after gaining more information of the evader under the adaptive interdiction policy. Given full access to the evader's destination information, we first propose a class of adaptive interdiction policies, which is demonstrated to consistently outperform the optimal static benchmark, regardless of the strategies implemented by the evader. Notably, we show that the performance gaps between our adaptive policy and the optimal static benchmark could be arbitrarily large, and this validates the significant value of adaptability in the network interdiction problem. Next, leveraging on linear duality theory, we revise the adaptive policy to deal with the case when the interdictor may not know the accurate destination information of the evader. The sequential interdiction manner allows the interdictor to utilize appropriate destination inference models to improve the interdiction performance. Encouraging computational results are reported on the Chicago sketch road network with 933 nodes and 2950 arcs. We propose an early-termination parallel algorithm to boost the computational efficiency. The numerical experiments validate the superior  performance of our proposed adaptive interdiction policy in comparison with the optimal static policy and state-of-the-art benchmarks. Interestingly, we observe that our adaptive policy could strategically induce the evader into a trap so that all the arcs emanating out of the trap node can be interdicted more effectively. This phenomenon illustrates the operational insight of our adaptive policy. </div></p>
